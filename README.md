# Library Management System

A simple **Library Management System** built with Python to manage books, members, and borrowing records.  
This is my first Python project after learning the basics and OOP concepts.

## Features
- Add new books to the library.
- Register members.
- Borrow and return books.
- Display all books and their status.
- Save and load data from a file.

├── member.py # Member class
├── library.py # Library class
├── data/ # Folder for storing data files
└── README.md # Project description

## Requirements
